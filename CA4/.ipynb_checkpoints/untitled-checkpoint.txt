### Practical Exercises

#### Part 1: Data Analysis and Familiarization
1. **Summary Statistics**: Use `describe` and `info` to get an overview.
2. **Missing Data**: Identify missing values and why they exist.
3. **Feature Plots**: Plot histograms and visualize feature distributions.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Understand the correlation between features and the target (`MEDV`).
5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Use scatter and hexbin plots to investigate relationships.
   - Feature selection based on correlation analysis.

#### Part 2: Data Processing and Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Apply at least three different methods for imputation.
2. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features.
3. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - Convert categorical features to numerical.
4. **Dataset Splitting**:
   - Split into train, validation, and test sets.

#### Part 3: Model Implementation and Evaluation
1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Implement Linear Regression without using external libraries.
   - Use Polynomial Regression with Gradient Descent.

2. **Classification Models**:
   - Implement Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
   - Compare performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Understand and apply Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forest.
   - Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
   - Implement SVM with Linear and RBF kernels.
   - Evaluate using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Decision Trees and KNN Classification

**Decision Trees**:
1. **Concepts**:
   - Understand `prune` and the pros/cons of pruning.
   - Identify advantages of Decision Trees over other models.
2. **KNN Algorithm**:
   - Investigate nearest neighbors techniques like `one nearest neighbor`.

**Decision Tree vs. KNN**:

| Method | Decision Trees | K-Nearest Neighbors |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Pros | Simple, interpretable | Flexible, handles noisy data |
| Cons | Overfitting, sensitive to data | Computationally expensive |

### Random Forests and Ensemble Methods

**Random Forests**:
1. **Concept**: 
   - Ensemble learning method that aggregates decisions from multiple decision trees.
2. **Bagging and Bootstrapping**:
   - Bagging involves sampling with replacement.
   - Bootstrapping ensures diversity among trees.

**XGBoost**:
1. **Gradient Boosting**:
   - Understand Gradient Boosting Decision Trees.
   - Explore XGBoost's hyperparameters.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

1. **Linear and RBF Kernel**:
   - Train SVM models using both kernels.
2. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

### Evaluation Metrics

**Confusion Matrix**:
- Visualize confusion matrices and derive metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.
